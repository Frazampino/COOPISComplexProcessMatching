prompt = f"""Compare the following two BPMN models in XML format and assess their similarity:

BPMN Model 1: {bpmn_file_1}
BPMN Model 2: {bpmn_file_2}

1. Provide a semantic similarity score from 0 to 1, where 0 means no similarity and 1 means perfect similarity, along with a brief explanation of the score.
2. Identify one-to-one mappings between tasks in both models based on their semantic meaning. Provide the mapping in a list format (e.g., Task 1 in Model 1 -> Task A in Model 2).
3. If gateways or other elements have significant differences, note them separately.

Respond in a clear and structured format."""
